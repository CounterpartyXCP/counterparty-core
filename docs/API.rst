Interacting with the API
=========================

.. warning::

    This API documentation is still in an early state. It contains errors, omissions, etc., and could change drastically at any time.
    

Overview
----------

``counterpartyd`` features a full-fledged JSON RPC 2.0-based API, which allows
third-party applications to perform functions on the Counterparty network
without having to deal with the low‚Äêlevel details of the protocol such as
transaction encoding and state management.


Connecting and Making Requests
---------------------------------

By default, ``counterpartyd`` will listen on port ``4000`` (if on mainnet) or port ``14000`` (on testnet) for API
requests. 

Note that this API is built on JSON-RPC 2.0, not 1.1. JSON-RPC itself is pretty lightweight, and API requests
are made via a HTTP POST request to ``/api/`` (note the trailing slash), with JSON-encoded data passed as the POST body.

General Format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All requests must have POST data that is JSON encoded and in the format of:

``{ "method": "METHOD NAME", "params": {"param1": "value1", "param2": "value2"}, "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 0 }``

In particular, note the ``jsonrpc`` and ``id`` properties. These are requirements under the JSON-RPC 2.0 spec.

Here's an example of the POST data for a valid API request:

.. code-block::

    {
      "method": "get_burns",
      "params": {"order_by": 'tx_hash',
                 "order_dir": 'asc',
                 "start_block": 280537,
                 "end_block": 280539},
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "id": 0,
    }

You should note that the data in ``params`` is a JSON object (e.g. mapping), not an array. In other words, 
**the API only supports named arguments, not positional arguments** (e.g. use
{"argument1": "value1", "argument2": "value2"} instead of ["value1", "value2"]). This is the case for safety and bug-minimzation reasons.

For more information on JSON RPC, please see the `JSON RPC 2.0 specification <http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification>`__.

Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Also note that the ``counterpartyd`` API interface requires HTTP basic authentication to use. The username and password required
are stored in the ``counterpartyd.conf`` file, as ``rpc-user`` and ``rpc-password``, respectively. You can also modify
``rpc-host`` and ``rpc-port`` to change what interface and port number ``counterpartyd`` binds to from the defaults.

.. _examples:

Below we provide a few examples of using the ``counterpartyd`` API. Examples in other languages are welcome,
if you'd like to submit them to us, structured in a way to be useful to other people and use standard libraries/methods. 

Python Example

    tx_hash = requests.post(url, data=json.dumps(payload), headers=headers, auth=auth)
    print("\BROADCAST_TX RESULT: ", tx_hash)
    

PHP Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^

With PHP, you can connect and query ``counterpartyd`` using the `JsonRPC <https://github.com/fguillot/JsonRPC>`__
library. Here's a simple example that will get you the asset balances for a specific address:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    require 'JsonRPC/src/JsonRPC/Client.php';
    use JsonRPC\Client;
    $client = new Client('http://localhost:4000/api/');
    $client->authentication('rpcuser', 'rpcpassword');
    
    $result = $client->execute('get_balances', array('filters' => array('field' => 'address', 'op' => '==', 'value' => '1NFeBp9s5aQ1iZ26uWyiK2AYUXHxs7bFmB')));
    print("get_balances result:\n");
    var_dump($result);
    
    $result2 = $client->execute('get_running_info');
    print("get_running_info result:\n");
    var_dump($result2);
    ?>
    
curl Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here's an example using ``curl`` to make an API call to the ``get_running_info`` method on mainnet.

.. code-block:: none

    curl http://127.0.0.1:4000/api/ --user rpcuser:rpcpassword -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8' -H 'Accept: application/json, text/javascript' --data-binary '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":0,"method":"get_running_info"}'

For testnet, you could use the example above, but change the port to ``14000`` and change the username and password as necessary.


Terms & Conventions
---------------------

.. _assets:

assets
^^^^^^^^^

Everywhere in the API an asset is referenced as an uppercase alphabetic (base
26) string name of the asset, of at least 4 characters in length and not starting with 'A', or as 'BTC' or 'XCP' as appropriate. Examples are:

- "BTC"
- "XCP"
- "FOOBAR"

.. _quantitys:

Quantities & balances
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Anywhere where an quantity is specified, it is specified in **satoshis** (if a divisible asset), or as whole numbers
(if an indivisible asset). To convert satoshis to floating-point, simply cast to float and divide by 100,000,000.

Examples:

- 4381030000 = 43.8103 (if divisible asset)
- 4381030000 = 4381030000 (if indivisible asset) 

**NOTE:** XCP and BTC themselves are divisible assets, and thus are listed in satoshis.

.. _floats:

floats
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Floats are are ratios or floating point values with six decimal places of precision, used in bets, dividends and callbacks.

.. _filtering:

Filtering Read API results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Counterparty API aims to be as simple and flexible as possible. To this end, it includes a straightforward
way to filter the results of most :ref:`Read API functions <read_api>` to get the data you want, and only that.

For each Read API function that supports it, a ``filters`` parameter exists. To apply a filter to a specific data field,
specify an object (e.g. dict in Python) as this parameter, with the following members:

- field: The field to filter on. Must be a valid field in the type of object being returned
- op: The comparison operation to perform. One of: ``"=="``, ``"!="``, ``">"``, ``"<"``, ``">="``, ``"<="``, ``"IN"``, ``"LIKE"``, ``"NOT IN"``, ``"NOT LIKE"``
- value: The value that the field will be compared against. Must be the same data type as the field is
  (e.g. if the field is a string, the value must be a string too)

If you want to filter by multiple fields, then you can specify a list of filter objects. To this end, API functions
that take ``filters`` also take a ``filterop`` parameter, which determines how the filters are combined when multiple
filters are specified. It defaults to ``"and"``, meaning that filters are ANDed togeher (and that any match
must satisfy all of them). You can also specify ``"or"`` as an alternative setting, which would mean that
filters are ORed together, and that any match must satisfy only one of them.

To disable filtering, you can just not specify the filter argument (if using keyword-based arguments), or,
if using positional arguments, just pass ``null`` or ``[]`` (empty list) for the parameter.

For examples of filtering in-use, please see the :ref:`API code examples <examples>`.

NOTE: Note that with strings being compared, operators like ``>=`` do a lexigraphic string comparison (which
compares, letter to letter, based on the ASCII ordering for individual characters. For more information on
the specific comparison logic used, please see `this page <http://www.sqlite.org/lang_expr.html>`__.

.. _encoding_param:

The ``encoding`` Parameter of ``create_`` Calls 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All ``create_`` API calls return an *unsigned raw transaction string*, hex encoded (i.e. the same format that ``bitcoind`` returns
with its raw transaction API calls).

The exact form and format of this unsigned raw transaction string is specified via the ``encoding`` and ``pubkey`` parameters on each ``create_``
API call:

- To return the transaction as an **OP_RETURN** transaction, specify ``opreturn`` for the ``encoding`` parameter.
  Note that as of ``bitcoind`` 0.9.0, not all Counterparty transactions are possible with OP_RETURN, due to the 40
  byte limit imposed by the ``bitcoind`` client in order for the transaction to be relayed on mainnet.
- To return the transaction as a **multisig** transaction, specify ``multisig`` for the ``encoding`` parameter.
    
    - If the source address is in the local ``bitcoind`` ``wallet.dat``. ``pubkey`` can be left as ``null``.
    - If the source address is *not* in the local ``bitcoind`` ``wallet.dat``, ``pubkey`` should be set to the hex-encoded
      public key.
- ``auto`` may also be specified to let ``counterpartyd`` choose here. Note that at this time, ``auto`` is effectively the same as
  ``multisig``.

- To return the Counterparty transaction encoded into arbitrary address outputs (i.e. pubkeyhash encoding), specify
  ``pubkeyhash`` for the ``encoding`` parameter. ``pubkey`` is also required to be set (as above, with ``multisig`` encoding)
  if the source address is not contained in the local ``bitcoind`` ``wallet.dat``. Note that this method is **not** recommended
  as a first-resort, as it pollutes the UTXO set.

With any of the above settings, as the *unsigned* raw transaction is returned from the ``create_`` API call itself, you
then have two approaches with respect to broadcasting the transaction on the network:

- If the private key you need to sign the raw transaction is in the local ``bitcoind`` ``wallet.dat``, you should then call the
  ``sign_tx`` API call and pass it to the raw unsigned transaction string as the ``tx_hex`` parameter, with the ``privkey`` parameter
  set to None. This method will then return the signed hex transaction, which you can then broadcast using the ``broadcast_tx``
  API method.
- If the private key you need to sign the raw transaction is *not* in the local ``bitcoind`` ``wallet.dat``, you must first sign
  the transaction yourself (or, alternatively, you can call the ``sign_tx`` API method and specify
  the private key string to it, and ``counterpartyd`` will sign it for you). In either case, once you have the signed,
  hex-encoded transaction string, you can then call the ``broadcast_tx`` API method, which will then broadcast the transaction on the
  Bitcoin network for you.
  
**Note that you can also use a :ref:`do_ call instead <do_table>`, which will take care of creating the transaction,
signing it, and broadcasting it, all in one step.**



.. _read_api:

Read API Function Reference
------------------------------------

.. _get_table:

get_{table}
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**get_{table}(filters=[], filterop='AND', order_by=None, order_dir=None, start_block=None, end_block=None, status=None,
limit=1000, offset=0, show_expired=True)**

**{table}** must be one of the following values:
``balances``, ``credits``, ``debits``, ``bets``, ``bet_matches``, ``broadcasts``, ``btcpays``, ``burns``, 
``callbacks``, ``cancels``, ``dividends``, ``issuances``, ``orders``, ``order_matches``, ``sends``, 
``bet_expirations``, ``order_expirations``, ``bet_match_expirations``, ``order_match_expirations``,
``rps``, ``rps_expirations``, ``rps_matches``, ``rps_match_expirations``, or ``rpsresolves``.

For example: ``get_balances``, ``get_credits``, ``get_debits``, etc are all valid API methods.

**Parameters:**

  * **filters (list/dict):** An optional filtering object, or list of filtering objects. See :ref:`Filtering Read API
    results <filtering>` for more information.
  * **filterop (string):** Specifies how multiple filter settings are combined. Defaults to ``AND``, but ``OR`` can
    be specified as well. See :ref:`Filtering Read API results <filtering>` for more information.
  * **order_by  (string):** If sorted results are desired, specify the name of an attribute of the appropriate table to
    order the results by (e.g. ``quantity`` for :ref:`balance objects <balance-object>`, if you called ``get_balances``).
    If left blank, the list of results will be returned unordered. 
  * **order_dir (string):** The direction of the ordering. Either ``ASC`` for ascending order, or ``DESC`` for descending
    order. Must be set if ``order_by`` is specified. Leave blank if ``order_by`` is not specified.
  * **start_block (integer):** If specified, only results from the specified block index on will be returned 
  * **end_block (integer):** If specified, only results up to and including the specified block index on will be returned
  * **status (string/list):** return only results with the specified status or statuses (if a list of status strings is supplied).
    See the :ref:`list of possible statuses <status-list>`. Note that if ``null`` is supplied (the default), then status is not filtered.
    Also note that status filtering can be done via the ``filters`` parameter, but doing it through this parameter is more
    flexible, as it essentially allows for situations where ``OR`` filter logic is desired, as well as status-based filtering.
  * **limit (integer):** (maximum) number of elements to return. Can specify a value less than or equal to 1000. For more results, use
    a combination of ``limit`` and ``offset`` parameters to paginate results.
  * **offset (integer):** return results starting from specified ``offset``

**Special Parameters:**

  * **show_expired (boolean):** used only for ``get_orders``. When false, get_orders don't return orders which expire next block.

**Return:**

  A list of objects with attributes corresponding to the queried table fields.

**Examples:**

  * To get a listing of bets, call ``get_bets``. This method will return a list of one or more :ref:`bet objects <bet-object>` .
  * To get a listing all open orders for a given address like 1Ayw5aXXTnqYfS3LbguMCf9dxRqzbTVbjf, you could call
    ``get_orders`` with the appropriate parameters. This method will return a list of one or more :ref:`order objects <order-object>`.

**Notes:**

  * Please note that the ``get_balances`` API call will not return balances for BTC itself. It only returns balances
    for XCP and other Counterparty assets. To get BTC-based balances, use an existing system such as Insight, blockr.io,
    or blockchain.info.

database actions and allows for lower-level state tracking for applications that hook into it.
   
**Parameters:**

  * **block_index (integer):** The block index for which to retrieve activity.

**Return:** 
  
  A list of one or more :ref:`messages <message-object>` if there was any activity in the block, otherwise ``[]`` (empty list).

.. _get_xcp_supply:

get_xcp_supply
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**get_xcp_supply()**

Gets the current total quantity of XCP in existance (i.e. quantity created via proof-of-burn, minus quantity
destroyed via asset issuances, etc).

**Parameters:**

  None

**Return:** 

  The :ref:`quantity <quantitys>` of XCP currently in existance.

.. _get_block_info:

get_block_info
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  - **block_hash** (*string*): The block hash identifier
  - **block_time** (*integer*): A UNIX timestamp of when the block was processed by the network 


.. _get_blocks:

get_blocks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**get_blocks(block_indexes)**

  - **block_hash** (*string*): The block hash identifier
  - **block_time** (*integer*): A UNIX timestamp of when the block was processed by the network
  - **_messages** (*list*): A list of one or more :ref:`messages <message-object>` if there was any activity in the block, otherwise ``[]`` (empty list).

get_running_info
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**get_running_info()**

Gets some operational parameters for counterpartyd.

**Parameters:**

  None

**Return:** 

  An object with the following parameters:

  - **db_caught_up** (*boolean*): ``true`` if counterpartyd block processing is caught up with the Bitcoin blockchain, ``false`` otherwise.

API Changes
-------------

This section documents any changes to the ``counterpartyd`` API, for version numbers where there were API-level modifications.

.. _9_32_0:

9.32.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Summary:** API framework overhaul for performance and simplicity 

* "/api" with no trailing slash no longer supported as an API endpoint (use "/" or "/api/" instead)
* We now consistently reject positional arguments with all API methods. Make sure your API calls do not use positional
  arguments (e.g. use {"argument1": "value1", "argument2": "value2"} instead of ["value1", "value2"])


.. _9_24_1:

9.24.1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Summary:** New API parsing engine added, as well as dynamic get_ method composition in ``api.py``: 

* Added ``sql`` API method
* Filter params: Added ``LIKE``, ``NOT LIKE`` and ``IN``


.. _9_25_0:

9.25.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* new do_* methods: like create_*, but also sign and broadcast the transaction. Same parameters as create_*, plus optional privkey parameter.

**backwards incompatible changes**

* create_*: accept only dict as parameters
* create_bet: ``bet_type`` must be a integer (instead string)
* create_bet: ``wager`` and ``counterwager`` args are replaced by ``wager_quantity`` and ``counterwager_quantity``
* create_issuance: parameter ``lock`` (boolean) removed (use LOCK in description)
* create_issuance: parameter ``transfer_destination`` replaced by ``destination``
* DatabaseError: now a DatabaseError is returned immediately if the counterpartyd database is behind the backend, instead of after fourteen seconds
