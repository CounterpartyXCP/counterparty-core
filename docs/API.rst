Interacting with the API
=========================

.. warning::

    This API documentation is still in an early state. It contains errors, omissions, etc., and could change drastically at any time.
    

Overview
----------

``counterpartyd`` features a full-fledged JSON RPC 2.0-based API, which allows
third-party applications to perform functions on the Counterparty network
without having to deal with the low‚Äêlevel details of the protocol such as
transaction encoding and state management.


Connecting to the API
----------------------

By default, ``counterpartyd`` will listen on port ``4000`` (if on mainnet) or port ``14000`` (on testnet) for API
requests. API requests are made via a HTTP POST request to ``/jsonrpc/``, with JSON-encoded
data passed as the POST body. For more information on JSON RPC, please see the `JSON RPC 2.0 specification <http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification>`__.

Terms & Conventions
---------------------

.. _assets:

assets
^^^^^^^^^

Everywhere in the API an asset is referenced as an uppercase alphabetic (base
26) string name of the asset, of at least 4 characters in length, or as 'BTC' or 'XCP' as appropriate. Examples are:

- "BTC"
- "XCP"
- "FOOBAR"

.. _amounts:

amounts & balances
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Anywhere where an amount is specified, it is specified in **satoshis** (if a divisible asset), or as whole numbers
(if an indivisible asset). To convert satoshis to floating-point, simply cast to float and divide by 100,000,000.

Examples:

- 4381030000 = 43.8103 (if divisible asset)
- 4381030000 = 4381030000 (if indivisible asset) 

**NOTE:** XCP and BTC themselves are divisible assets, and thus are listed in satoshis.

.. _filtering:

Filtering Read API results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Counterparty API aims to be as simple and flexible as possible. To this end, it includes a straightforward
way to filter the results of most :ref:`Read API functions <read_api>` to get the data you want, and only that.

For each Read API function that supports it, a ``filters`` parameter exists. To apply a filter to a specific data field,
specify an object (e.g. dict in Python) as this parameter, with the following members:

- field: The field to filter on. Must be a valid field in the type of object being returned
- op: The comparison operation to perform. One of: ``"=="``, ``"!="``, ``">"``, ``"<"``, ``">="``, ``"<="``
- value: The value that the field will be compared against. Must be the same data type as the field is
  (e.g. if the field is a string, the value must be a string too)

If you want to filter by multiple fields, then you can specify a list of filter objects. To this end, API functions
that take ``filters`` also take a ``filterop`` parameter, which determines how the filters are combined when multiple
filters are specified. It defaults to ``"and"``, meaning that filters are ANDed togeher (and that any match
must satisfy all of them). You can also specify ``"or"`` as an alternative setting, which would mean that
filters are ORed together, and that any match must satisfy only one of them.

To disable filtering, you can just not specify the filter argument (if using keyword-based arguments), or,
if using positional arguments, just pass ``null`` or ``[]`` (empty list) for the parameter.

For examples of filtering in-use, please see the :ref:`API code examples <examples>`.

NOTE: Note that with strings being compared, operators like ``>=`` do a lexigraphic string comparison (which
compares, letter to letter, based on the ASCII ordering for individual characters. For more information on
the specific comparison logic used, please see `this page <http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#comparisons>`__.
