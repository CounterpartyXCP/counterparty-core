counterpartyd
==================================================

Counterparty is a protocol for the creation and use of decentralised financial instruments such as asset
exchanges, contracts for difference and dividend payments. It uses Bitcoin as a transport layer.
The Counterparty protocol specification may be found `here <https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/Counterparty>`__.

``counterpartyd`` is the reference client (and server daemon) implementation of the Counterparty protocol.

To get ``counterpartyd`` installed and set up on your computer, you have two options:

- Set it up manually, using the instructions `here <https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/counterpartyd/blob/master/README.md>`__
- For Windows and Ubuntu Linux users, you can use the `automated build system <http://counterpartyd-build.rtfd.org>`__
