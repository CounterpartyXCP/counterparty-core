## Library Versions ##
* Next Release
    * Moved check for invalid broadcast to better place to prevent broadcasting a cancel on a locked feed. (protocol change: )
    * Only use first usable input for source. (protocol change: )
    * lock UTXOs used to construct a transaction for 3 seconds to avoid a user double spending against himself.
    * P2SH support for source / destination of addresses (protocol change: )
    * Many many improvements to test suite
* v9.54.0 (2016-03-05)
    * Execute post install tasks when called via `pip`
    * Max fee fraction of 1
    * Don't handle bet matches for invalid broadcast.
* v9.53.0 (2016-01-18)
    * Remove `messages` table from being covered by "undolog" functionality added in `v9.52.0`.
    * Add `min_message_index` to `get_blocks` API call.
    * Retry more than once with `getrawtransaction_batch` if a specific txhash is not found in `bitcoind`'s addrindex.
    * Update `setup.py` to properly utilize (newer) egg-style install. Previously the "old" style install was invoked when it shouldn't have been.
    * Update backend mempool caching code to keep full mempool, instead of just XCP transactions (from @rubensayshi).
    * Increase max `OP_RETURN` size used from 40 bytes to 80 bytes (from @rubensayshi).
    * Add ModuleLoggingFilter for (NodeJS-style) module-level log filtering (from @rubensayshi).
    * Fixed `backend.get_unspent_outputs` from raising exception when a transaction contains an output with garbage data (from @rubensayshi).
    * `base58_check_decode` padding byte used should be `x00`, not the `version` (from @rubensayshi).
    * Require `sudo` for non-container `travis` builds, due to our `serpent` dependency (from @rubensayshi).
    * Made `getrawtransaction_batch` deal better with missing raw transactions from `bitcoind`.
    * A number of other small bug fixes, logging tweaks, etc.
    * NOTE: This versions mhash (message hash) will be different than that of nodes running `9.52.0`, but the other hashes should continue to match.
* v9.52.0 (2015-10-31)
    * Added "undolog" functionality to avoid full reparses when encountering a blockchain reorganisation
    * Removed use of `tornado` library in the API module. We use `flask`'s threaded server instead
    * Added `getrawtransaction` and `getrawtransaction_batch` methods to the API
    * Added optional `custom_inputs` parameter to API calls, which allows for controlling the exact UTXOs to use in transactions (thanks, tokenly)
