# Release Notes - Counterparty Core v10.1.2 (2024-05-06)

This version of Counterparty Core marks the release of API v2, a new RESTful APIâ€”see the [official project documentation](https://docs.counterparty.io/docs/advanced/api-v2/node-api/). The new API is available at `/v2/`, while the old API is now available at `/v1/` in addition to `/`.


# Upgrading

There is a [guide for migrating from the v1 to the v2 API](https://docs.counterparty.io/docs/advanced/api-v2/v1-to-v2/) in the documentation, which specifies equivalences between old and new functionality. 

This release maintains full backwards-compatibility and includes no protocol changes.
