# Release Notes - Counterparty Core v11.0.0 (2025-05-14)

Counterparty Core v11.0.0 is a large release with numerous protocol upgrades and many miscellaneous improvements to the API, CLI and codebase, including significantly increased test coverage.

**Protocol Upgrades:**
- Fix Bech32 address handlingâ€”now support P2WSH and P2TR
- Support for Taproot envelope data encoding, which will significantly reduce transaction fees for larger transactions (and removal of support for P2SH data encoding, which is strictly worse than Taproot)
- Support for Ordinals Inscription creation when composing an Issuance, Fairminter or Broadcast (API parameters: `inscription`, `mime_type`)
- Allow `soft_cap` to be equal to `hard_cap` with Fairminters
- Add `max_mint_per_address` parameter to Fairminters (API parameter: `max_mint_per_address`)

# Upgrading

**This release is a protocol upgrade. All nodes must upgrade by block 898800.**

**Important** A bug in Bech32 and Taproot address handling introduced in 2018 caused these addresses to be stored in the database incorrectly. As part of fixing this, and adding proper support for P2WSH and P2TR address types, a full database reparse is required. This operation takes approximately 7 hours on an M3 Mac. As a consequence, Counterparty Core >= v11.0.0 will have all consensus hashes and checkpoints updated retroactively.

**Upgrade Instructions:**
To upgrade, download the latest version of `counterparty-core` and restart `counterparty-server`.

With Docker Compose:

```bash
cd counterparty-core
git pull
docker compose stop counterparty-core
docker compose --profile mainnet up -d
```

or use `ctrl-c` to interrupt the server:

```bash
cd counterparty-core
git pull
cd counterparty-rs
pip install -e .
cd ../counterparty-core
pip install -e .
counterparty-server start
```

# ChangeLog

## Protocol

- Add Taproot envelope data encoding support (disabled for transactions with a destination output and `detach`)
- Add support for Taproot change address
- Remove P2SH data encoding support
- Use an envelope script compatible with Ordinals when the description/text of a Fairminter, Issuance or Broadcast is not empty

- Add `mime_type` to `issuances`, `fairminters` and `broadcasts` tables

## API

- When using an Ordinals envelope script, add a dust output for the source address
- Add `asset` as an optional parameter to the Get Balances by Addresses endpoint
- The `encoding` parameter now accepts a `taproot` value
- Ensure that Fairminter's `start_block` and `end_block` are greater than the current block
- In Compose Fairminter, rename `price` -> `lot_price` and `quantity_by_price` -> `lot_size`
- In Compose Fairmint, ensure that `quantity` is a multiple of `lot_size`
- Ensure that Fairminter's `hard_cap` is greater than the sum of `premint_quantity` and `soft_cap`
- `POST` URL-encoded parameters are now accepted when composing a transaction
- Add `mime_type` parameter to `compose_issuance`, `compose_fairminter` and `compose_broadcast` endpoints
- Remove mandatory fields for broadcast: `fee_fraction`, `value`, `timestamp`
- Add `inscription` parameter to the compose API
- Add `category` field to functions and arguments in `/v2/routes` endpoint response

## CLI
